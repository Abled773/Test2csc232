Programming Problem 9------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the implementation is written for you in the textbook

the method just needs to
peek() --> save result
pop()
peek()
push(result)

its technically not removing it from the stack as a whole so i say it counts

2----------------------------------------------------
a. yes if you use an arraystack you can store which the value being pop and send it to the ADT bag's remove method
b. No as it would be unable to remove an item in the bag

3--------------------------------------------------
b. dont feel like doing rn
c. we have already done

5------------------------------------------------------
remove(int n)
  int i = 0;
  while(i < n)
     stack.pop
      i++
